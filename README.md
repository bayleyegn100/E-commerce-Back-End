## Description 

This back end app is built for an e-commerce site. It has three sections category, product and tag. By using this app a user is able to get, create, update, and delete categories, products and tags when necessery. 
To develop this application I used diffrent technologies including express, mysql2, seed, sequlize, Javascript, a software registry and software package manager and installer called Node Package Manager (npm)node.js and other relevant node.js frameworks.
